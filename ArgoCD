1. What is ArgoCD?
ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It follows the Pull Model: instead of a CI/CD tool (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions) "pushing" 
code into your cluster, ArgoCD "pulls" configuration from your Git repository into the cluster.

2. Why Use It? (The "SME" Reasoning)
a) Drift Detection: If a developer manually changes a setting in the cluster (e.g., changes a traffic split to 100/0), ArgoCD detects that this doesn't match Git and 
automatically "syncs" it back to the correct state.
b) Self-Healing: If an Istio Gateway or an application pod is deleted by mistake, ArgoCD immediately recreates it.
c) Version Control for Infra: Every change to your 3-layer defense (Timeouts, Retries) is recorded in Git. If a change breaks the site, you can "Rollback" with one click in Git.

3. The Infrastructure (How it lives in AKS)
ArgoCD runs as a set of pods within your cluster (usually in an argocd namespace). Its architecture consists of:
a) API Server: Handles the Web UI and CLI requests.
b) Repository Server: Keeps a local cache of your Git files.
c) Application Controller: The "Brain." It compares the Live State (what’s in AKS) with the Desired State (what’s in Git).
d) Redis: For fast data caching.

4. Key Features & Functions
a) Multi-Cluster Management: One ArgoCD instance can manage deployments across multiple AKS clusters (e.g., India, USA, and Europe).
b) RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): You can define who can sync traffic rules and who can only view them.
c) Visual Health Status: It provides a tree-view dashboard showing exactly which pods are healthy and which are out-of-sync.
